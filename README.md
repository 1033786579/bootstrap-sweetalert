# SweetAlert for Bootstrap

An awesome replacement for JavaScript's alert.


#### This is a clone for Bootstrap. For more refer to the [original project](https://github.com/t4t5/sweetalert).


## Usage

If your project is using Less and the original source of Bootstrap then just
include the `sweet-alert.less` file in your building process.

Otherwise include the JavaScript and CSS files manually:

```html
<script src="lib/sweet-alert.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="lib/sweet-alert.css">
```


## Development

```shell
$ npm install
$ grunt
```
